Nowadays microprocessors ar multiprocessors as well with each chip called "socket" having multiple processors  called cores on it.32

At the beginning  of each instruction  cycle (Fetch and execution  stage) CPU first fetches  instruction  from memory. PC or program counter holds the address of the next instruction  to be fetched.Unless instructed otherwise  the CPU usually  increments the PC after fetch. The fetched instruction  is then loaded into IR (instruction  register).Instruction contains bits that specify the action which falls under one of the four categories:

-processor memory: 

Transference  of data between memory and vice versa

processor IO: Transference  between an IO device and processor and vice versa


Data processing: processing arithmetic /logic operations 


Control:Controlling where to get the next instruction  from in the fetch stage for example.




Processor contains a single data register called the accumulator (AC).Both instructions and data are 16 bits  long and memory is organized as a sequence of 16 bit words. The instruction format  provides 4 bits for the opcode allowing 2 to the power of 4 different opcodes representation by a single hexadecimal digit. The remaining 12 bits of the instruction format allow upto 2 to the power of 12 or 4 K words of memory ( denoted by three hexadecimal digits) can be directly addressed.34
