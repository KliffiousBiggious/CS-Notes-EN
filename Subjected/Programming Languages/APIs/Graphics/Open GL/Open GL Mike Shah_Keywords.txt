Open GL Pipeline: A vertex/Line/Triangle 's journey from 3D data to your 2D screen
E4

Vertex specification: Where we setup on the CPU or geometry E4

Shader: A programmable part of our pipeline (Feature of modern OpenGL that we can run programs on GPU to control the graphics pipeline) E4

Vertex Shader: Execute on each vertex, positioning that vertex as a result
E4

Tessellation (Optional) : When we add more triangles by dividing the current ones in order to get more detail
E4

Geometry Shader (Optional) : Generate more geometry out of a point (Like in the explosion) E4

Vertex Post- Processing: When



Primitive Assembly: How are we assembling all the primitives (Are they points, lines , etc) Assembling the final geometry that's within view
E4

Rasterization: Filling boxes (pixels) to make a shape E4

Fragment Shader : Executing once on each fragment pixel. Determine the final color of each pixel E4
