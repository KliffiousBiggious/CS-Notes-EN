Stack Frame/Activation Record:
Contains the return address that the called function needs in order to return to the calling function. It also contains some additional informa-tion we’ll soon discuss. If the called function returns instead of calling another function before returning, the stack frame for the function call is popped, and control transfers to the return address in the popped stack frame.
It can also be used to reserve memory for local variables.278

data structures: They are collections of related data items.324

arrays: fixed-size collections consisting of data items of the same type.324



vectors:collections (also of data items of the same type) that can grow and shrink dynamically at execution time.Both array and vector are C++ standard library class templates. 324


Access Functions:They can read or display data, not modify it. Another common use of access functions is to test the truth or falsity of conditions—such functions are often called predicate functions. An example would be an empty function for any container class—a class capable of holding many objects, such as an array or a vector. A program might test empty before attempting to read another item from the container object.439



Destructors: It's a nother type of special member function. The name of the destructor for a class is tilde character
(~) followed by tha class name.445
