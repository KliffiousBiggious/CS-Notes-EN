{}: List assignment in C++.91

getline(cin,strvariable): A function of <string> header used to input strings with the whitespace.117

const: If comes after the parentheses of a method. It means that It shall not modify the object of the class.122

private:Access specifiers are always followed by a colon (:). Data member name’s declaration (line 18) appears after access specifier private: to indicate that name is accessible only to class Account’s member functions.122

public: Data members or member functions listed after access specifier public (and before the next access specifier if there is one) are “available to the public.”.They can be used by other functions in the program (such as main), and by member functions of other classes (if thereare any). In Chapter 11, we’ll introduce the protected access specifier. 123

private: is a an access specifier that causes the name to be accessible only to the member functions.123

bool: datatype that can hold values true(1)
or false (0).

<climits>: can determine your platform’s type limits.161

static_cast <type>(number): casts the following variable to the said type.169



setpricision():When the stream manipulators fixed and setprecision are used, the printed value is rounded to the number of decimal positions indicated by setprecision’s argument.170

left : Used to define output field justification before we specify the length in set() which is in <iomanip> header file.208

right : Used to define output field justification before we specify the length in set() which is in <iomanip> header file.208



setwidth(): Sets field length for its following variable.208



return: It can be used explicitly in functions with no return value to retun control to the program.257

inline: This keyword before short bodied functions suggests the  compiler to just downright copy the body of the function on the next calls to it.283


:: : This operator is used to access a global variable when a local variable of the same name is in scope. Always using the unary scope resolution operator (::) to refer to global variables (even if there is no collision with a local-variable name) makes it clear that you’re intending to access a global variable rather than a local variable. 287


template <typename/class T> :All function template definitions begin with the template keyword followed by a template parameter list enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).Every parameter in the template parameter list is preceded by keyword typename or keyword class (they are synonyms in this context). The type parameters are placeholders for fundamental types or user-defined types. These placeholders, in this case, T, are used to specify the types of the function’s parameters to specify the function’s return type and to declare variables within the body of the function definition. A function template is defined like any other function, but uses the type parameters as placeholders for actual data types.291


array<type,arraysize> arrayname: The notation  indicates that array is a class template.The notation  indicates that array is a class template. The compiler reserves the appropriate amount of memory based on the type of the elements and the arraySize.326

auto: Means it would determine the type of the variable at compile time automatically based on the rest of the expression. Usually used for when writing type could get complex(Would appreciate more info on that later).Main usage in  range based loop in order to determine the type of lvalue in list.349

try: .362

throw: .431



classname::function(){}: We use the :: to address the scope resolution(class) for the function we are defining in a file so that it can access the private variables of the said
class.430


:  :Colon can be uses for function delegation, to run a function with specific parameters upon encountering a specific number of parameters.444-445

~classname: It's how we declare a destructor.445

exit/abort: .446



=: The assignment sign can be used for objects of the same class to assing the damamembers.451

this: is a pointer tp the address of the obj of a class.463

Class ClassName: accessmodifier derived ClassName:
Used to inherit a class.539
