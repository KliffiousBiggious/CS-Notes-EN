******* Any software that does 
something that causes detriment to the user, computer, or network—such as viruses, trojan horses, worms, rootkits, scareware, and spyware—can be considered malware.1 *******

******* Host-based signatures are used to detect malicious code on victim computers thru  observing the created or modified files and changes that it makes to the registry. Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of the malware itself, which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk.2 ****** 

******* Network signatures are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more effective, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives.2 *******

******* 
Static malware analysis is about examining malware without running it.

Dynamic malware analysis is about examining malware WHILE running it.2 *******

******* Static and Dynamic Analysis both of which could come in basic and advanced forms:

Basic Static: Analyzing without actually looking at its code and providing simple signatures.

Advanced Static: Reverse engineering the malware by using disassemblers and peeking thru its codes.

Basic Dynamic: Running the malware in a ready safe and set up environment to see what it does.

Advanced Dynamic: Using Debugger to see what the malware is doing step by step.3 *******


******* Types of Malware: 

Backdoor: Malicious code that installs itself onto a computer to allow the attacker access. Backdoors usually let the attacker connect to the computer with little or no authentication and execute commands on the 
local system.

Botnet: Similar to a backdoor, in that it allows the attacker access to the system, but all computers infected with the same botnet receive the same instructions from a single command-and-control server.

Downloader: Malicious code that exists only to download other malicious code. Downloaders are commonly installed by attackers when they first gain access to a system. The downloader program will download and install additional malicious code.

Information-stealing malware: Malware that collects information from a victim’s computer and usually sends it to the attacker. Examples include 
sniffers, password hash grabbers, and keyloggers. This malware is typically used to gain access to online accounts such as email or online banking.

Launcher: Malicious program used to launch other malicious programs. 
Usually, launchers use nontraditional techniques to launch other malicious programs in order to ensure stealth or greater access to a system.

Rootkit: Malicious code designed to conceal the existence of other 
code. Rootkits are usually paired with other malware, such as a backdoor,to allow remote access to the attacker and make the code difficult for the victim to detect.

Scareware: Malware designed to frighten an infected user into buying something. It usually has a user interface that makes it look like an antivirus or other security program. It informs users that there is malicious 
code on their system and that the only way to get rid of it is to buy their  “software,” when in reality, the software it’s selling does nothing more than remove the scareware.

Spam-sending: Malware that infects a user’s machine and then uses that machine to send spam. This malware generates income for attackers by allowing them to sell spam-sending services.

Worm or virus: Malicious code that can copy itself and infect additional computers. 

Malware often spans multiple categories. For example, a program might have a keylogger that collects passwords and a worm component that sends spam. Don’t get too caught up in classifying malware according to its 
functionality.3-4 *******
